Every morning, an old man named Mr. Rafi sat on a wooden bench outside his tiny caf√© at the corner of a quiet street. His table always had two cups: one filled with tea, the other with coffee.

People passing by often asked,
‚ÄúWhy both? You only ever drink one!‚Äù

Mr. Rafi would smile and say,
‚ÄúOne is for me. The other is for whoever needs a moment.‚Äù

Some mornings, a tired worker would sit and sip the coffee. Other days, a lonely student would pause for tea. A young mother, an old friend, a stranger with sad eyes ‚Äî all sat with Mr. Rafi at some point, drinking warmth and finding quiet company.

He never charged for the second cup.

Years passed, and Mr. Rafi grew slower, but the two cups never disappeared. One morning, someone came to the caf√© and saw only one cup on the table ‚Äî untouched.

They sat down, poured themselves coffee from the pot nearby, and waited. Soon, someone else came, then another. Each poured their own second cup and shared stories, just like Mr. Rafi once had.

Though the old man had quietly passed, his kindness lived on ‚Äî in two cups and the space between them.
