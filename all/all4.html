In the heart of the forest, the annual Forest Talent Show was the biggest event of the year. Animals of all shapes and sizes came to sing, dance, juggle, and show off their special talents.

But Barry the Bear was nervous. He didn’t sing like the nightingale. He didn’t dance like the deer. He didn’t tell jokes like the fox.

He mumbled, “No one wants to see a big ol’ bear do anything.”

Then, an idea struck him. “What if… I was someone else?”

Barry stitched together twigs, moss, and wool into a silly but charming goat costume—complete with floppy ears, a fake beard, and little horns made from curled bark.

On the night of the show, Barry stepped onto the stage and announced in a squeaky voice,
“Hello! I’m Gary the Goat, and I’m here to tap dance!”

The forest roared with laughter and cheers as Barry tap-danced across the stage, bleated like a goat, and even chewed on a paper “tin can” for fun.

He didn’t trip. He didn’t freeze. He shined.

When the show ended, Barry pulled off the costume.

The owl judge hooted, “That was hilarious! But the best part wasn’t the costume—it was your courage.”

Barry grinned. “I thought I had to pretend to be someone else… but really, I just needed to believe I could be me, even under a goat.”
