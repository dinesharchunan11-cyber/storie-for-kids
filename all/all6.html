There once was a curious little girl named Lina who lived in a small village surrounded by hills and flowers. One spring morning, her grandmother gave her a tiny brown seed in a folded piece of paper.

“What kind of flower will it be?” Lina asked.

Her grandmother smiled. “That’s the magic — you won’t know until you care for it.”

Excited, Lina found the perfect sunny spot in her backyard. She dug a hole, planted the seed, and watered it carefully. Every day, she talked to it, sang to it, and made sure it had everything it needed.

Weeks passed.

Her friends laughed. “It’s just dirt,” they teased. “There’s nothing there!”

But Lina believed. She kept tending to her little patch of soil, no matter what anyone said.

Then one morning, something amazing happened — a tiny green sprout peeked out of the ground. Days later, it grew taller, stronger, and bloomed into a beautiful flower unlike any other in the village — bright gold with petals that shimmered in the sun.

Everyone who saw it gasped. “How did you grow that?” they asked.

Lina just smiled and said,
“I didn’t stop believing, even when nothing showed.”
