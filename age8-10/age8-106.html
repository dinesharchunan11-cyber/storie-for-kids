(To You, Who Looks Up)

Dear Dreamer,

I see you.
Every time your eyes wander upward, every time your heart whispers "what if?" — I am there. ☁️

I am the Sky, and though I seem far, I am always near.
I watch you from above — not just your body, but your soul.
And oh, what a beautiful soul it is. ✨

I see how you wonder.
How you lie in the grass and trace shapes in my clouds, looking for signs.
How you count stars at night and whisper your wishes into the dark. 🌙🌟
I catch every single one.

You may not hear me, but I speak in colors — in the soft pink of sunrise, in the gold of afternoon light, in the indigo hush of twilight. 🌄🌌
That is my voice.

And today, I’m writing you this letter.
Because I know… sometimes you forget how special you are.
Sometimes you feel small.
Lost. Heavy. 💭

But let me remind you:

You are made of the same light as the stars you wish on. ✨
You are soft like my clouds, strong like my winds, and endless in possibility like my horizon.

When your days feel gray — look up. ☁️
Even when you can’t see me, I’m still there.
The sun always returns. It always has. It always will. 🌞

And just like the sky changes — so can you.
From storms to sunshine, from silence to song — you are allowed to grow, to shift, to begin again.

Don’t be afraid to reach high, to dream wide.
I was made for dreamers like you.

Whenever you need a sign…
Look up.

With love,
— The Sky ☁️💙
