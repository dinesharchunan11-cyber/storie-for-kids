(An oral story with a whisper of wonder and a lesson to remember)

Let me tell you a tale — not one from books or scrolls, no. This one was carried on the wind, told by stars, and remembered by the moon 🌌. It’s the story of a girl, beautiful as springtime and strange as twilight.

Her name was Lina. 🌸

She had hair that shimmered like a waterfall at sunset, skin kissed by starlight, and eyes that seemed to hold whole galaxies inside. 🌠 But her beauty was not just in how she looked — it was in how she saw the world.

But here’s the strange thing: Lina didn’t live in our world. No, she lived in a dream. 💤

Not just any dream. This one was made of floating islands, skies that melted like honey, animals that spoke in poems, and flowers that bloomed with laughter. 🦋🌈 The dream loved Lina, and she loved it back. It gave her wings to fly, songs to sing, and nights full of stardust and stories.

She didn’t wake up like we do. Every time her body slept, her soul would rise, and in the dream she would live a whole lifetime in a single night. 👣

Now, in that world, she met someone. A boy made of mirror-glass and wind, whose name was Orin. He was kind and curious, but his eyes were different. They weren’t filled with dreams — they were filled with truth.

One night, as they danced on the edge of the sky, Orin whispered:

“Lina… what if this is not living? What if it’s just hiding?”

She paused. The stars held their breath. ⭐

“But this dream is beautiful,” Lina said. “It’s better than the pain out there.”

Orin nodded. “Yes… but real beauty needs roots. Even flowers in dreams can’t grow without soil.” 🌱

Lina was torn. The dream was safe. Soft. Sweet. But in her heart, something stirred — a longing for sunlight, for real laughter, for real tears.

That night, for the first time, Lina opened her eyes.

She woke.

The world was not perfect. The ground was hard. The air was cold. Her body ached from all the years asleep. But she smiled. Because now she saw beauty not just in the dream… but in the cracks, in the struggle, in the realness of life.

She learned to walk again, to speak, to live — slowly, but surely. And her beauty? It only grew — because now it came from courage, not fantasy.

💫
