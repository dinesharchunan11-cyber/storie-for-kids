Come close now, and listen to the wind...
It carries old stories — stories that don’t walk, but stand. Like this one.

Long ago, in the heart of a green valley, there stood a tree. 🌳
It wasn’t the tallest.
It didn’t have flowers like the others.
Its fruit was small, and its leaves were quiet.

But there was something special about this tree — it had been watching the world for hundreds of years. 👁️✨

People called it "Grandmother Tree", though it had no name of its own.

It had watched kings rise and fall, watched children grow up, fall in love, grow old, and disappear like the morning mist. 🌅

It had seen storms roar and the sun kiss the earth.
Birds made homes in its branches. Lovers carved names into its bark. 🕊️❤️

But still, the tree stood. Silently. Steadily.

One day, a little girl named Lina came to sit beneath it. 🌸
She was small, curious, and full of questions.

“Tree,” she whispered, “do you ever wish you could walk like people do?”

The tree didn’t speak with words. But its leaves rustled gently, and a breeze wrapped around Lina like an answer:

“No. People walk to find meaning. I stand to become it.” 🌿

Lina visited every day after that.

She brought her worries, her dreams, her secrets. The tree said nothing, but somehow… it always made her feel heard.

Years passed.

Lina grew tall. The tree grew older. One day, she came crying, heartbroken from the world.

She hugged the trunk and whispered,

“Everything changes. Nothing stays. Why does it hurt so much?”

The tree stood still, branches swaying in the wind.
And then — a leaf floated down and landed in her hand. 🍃
It was dry, gold, and beautiful.

In that moment, Lina understood.

Even letting go can be beautiful.
Even loss is part of growing.
Even stillness is not silence. 🌼

  <dd><h3>Be like the tree. Stay rooted in who you are, grow quietly, and offer shade to those who need it.
You don’t have to shout to be strong. 🌳💚
