 Let me tell you a story ‚Äî not one you read in a book, no. This one lives between waking and sleep, in the soft places where dreams make their home.

There once was a boy ‚Äî or maybe a girl, maybe both, maybe neither. Let‚Äôs call them Ash. Ash was born in a small, silent village tucked between a silver river and a forest that whispered when the wind got curious.

Ash was like the rest of us in many ways ‚Äî ate berries, climbed trees, danced in the rain when it came. But from the moment Ash was born, they were different in one way: they never truly woke up.

You see, Ash lived inside a dream. Not a dream like we all do sometimes, not a passing flicker behind the eyes. No ‚Äî Ash lived in a full world, woven of mist and memory. Their eyes opened each day not to sunlight and chores, but to endless oceans in the sky, talking birds, mountains that breathed like beasts.

Now some folks would call that madness. But to Ash, it was life ‚Äî their real, warm, breathing life.

In this dreamworld, Ash could run faster than any deer, leap from cloud to cloud, speak with the moon when she felt lonely. They could fly, swim through air, shape stars into toys. Every night held new wonders, and the days? Well, they passed like the hush between two songs.

But here‚Äôs where the story bends, so lean in now.

One day, Ash met a stranger in the dream ‚Äî a girl with skin like stone and eyes like cracked glass. Her name was Ora, and she said one thing:

"I used to dream like you. Then I woke up."

Ash laughed. Woke up? They were the ones who lived ‚Äî this was life, wasn‚Äôt it?

Ora just looked at them, sad and still. ‚ÄúThe longer you stay, the harder it is to leave.‚Äù

Then she disappeared, like a sigh on the wind.

That night, Ash couldn‚Äôt fly. Couldn‚Äôt breathe the stars. The clouds sagged like damp wool, and the moon wouldn‚Äôt speak. Something in the dream had changed ‚Äî or maybe, Ash had changed.

Now Ash faced a choice.

Stay, and let the dream become all there is ‚Äî soft and slow, until the real world fades completely. Or try to wake up. Feel the cold floor, the stiff body, the weight of living. The pain. But also the taste of real bread, the touch of another‚Äôs hand. The songs of actual birds.

Nobody knows what Ash chose ‚Äî not for sure.

Some say they‚Äôre still dreaming, and if you listen close at night, you‚Äôll hear them laughing in the clouds. Others say Ash woke, and now lives quietly among us, a little tired, a little quiet ‚Äî but their eyes? They still see wonders the rest of us forget.

So if you ever find yourself in a dream that feels too perfect, where the sky knows your name and the wind sings to you ‚Äî look around. Ash might be near.

And maybe‚Ä¶ just maybe‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre dreaming too.
