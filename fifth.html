A Mountain Tale of Rain, Laughter, and Light

High in the misty mountains of Eritrea, where the wind sang through the trees and wildflowers painted the hills, lived a little girl named Lina.

Lina was not like the other children in her village.

While they waited for sunny days to play outside, Lina loved the rain.

She loved the smell of wet earth, the sound of drops tapping on leaves, and the way puddles reflected the sky like tiny mirrors. Rain, to Lina, was like a song only her heart could hear.

‚ÄúRain makes everything feel alive,‚Äù she would say, spinning in circles on the porch.

One morning, as the village stirred from sleep, dark clouds gathered over the mountains. A hush fell over the trees. The sky rumbled low, and soft raindrops began to fall.

Most children ran indoors. Parents closed windows. Even the goats hurried into their shelters.

But not Lina.

She stepped out barefoot into the muddy path, lifted her face to the clouds, and smiled.

Then‚Äîwithout a word‚Äîshe began to twirl.

Her arms opened like wings, her skirt floated in circles, and her laughter bubbled out like a spring. She twirled once, twice, again and again, letting the rain kiss her cheeks and tickle her eyelashes.

Up in the trees, a monkey peeked out, curious.
From behind a bush, a fox watched silently.
Birds chirped, almost like they were clapping.

And then... something wonderful happened.

The entire forest seemed to wake up.

Leaves rustled in rhythm. Raindrops danced on petals. Even the wind changed ‚Äî soft, warm, and playful, as if it were dancing with her.

Lina‚Äôs joy was so bright, so full, that it spilled into everything around her.

Soon, a few other children came to the windows.
Then to their doorsteps.
Then out into the rain.

First a boy jumped in a puddle. Then a girl joined in a splash. Before long, the whole path was full of dancing, laughing children.

And in the center of it all was Lina, her eyes shining, her heart wide open, sharing her joy like sunshine through the storm.

When the rain finally slowed and the clouds parted, the world seemed softer‚Ä¶ lighter‚Ä¶ happier.

And though the sun peeked through, no one rushed to dry off. They stood together, wet and giggling, thankful for a morning that began with clouds, but ended in magic.
