A Garden Tale About Patience and Purpose

In a bright, blooming garden full of butterflies, buzzing bees, and busy bugs, lived a little snail named Sammy.

Sammy was gentle and thoughtful, with a shiny shell and a big dream:
He wanted to reach the biggest flower in the garden.

It stood tall and colorful in the distance, with petals as wide as clouds and the sweetest-smelling nectar in the whole meadow.

One morning, Sammy set off on his journey.

“I’m coming, flower!” he whispered.

But Sammy was slow. Very slow.

As he slid along the grass, other animals zoomed by.

“Still crawling?” laughed Cricket.
“You’ll never make it!” said Ladybug, zipping past.
Even Ants marched past him in long, quick lines.

But Sammy just smiled and said, “Step by step. I’ll get there.”

He crawled under leaves.
He slid over pebbles.
He rested in the shade when the sun was too hot.
And then, he moved again.

Hours passed.
Then a whole day.

The other animals had already reached the flower, sipped the nectar, and left.

But Sammy kept going — slowly, steadily, never giving up.

Finally, as the sun began to set, Sammy arrived.

The big flower swayed in the wind. Its petals glowed golden.
Sammy took a sip of the nectar and closed his eyes.

It was the sweetest thing he had ever tasted.

Soon, the animals who had rushed ahead returned and saw Sammy smiling beside the flower.

“You really made it?” asked Cricket.
“How?” asked Ladybug.

Sammy looked up and said simply, “I kept going.”

The animals were quiet for a moment… then began to clap and cheer.

From that day on, they never laughed at slow steps again — because they saw how far they could go.
