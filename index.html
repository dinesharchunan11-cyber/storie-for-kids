        <pre><h3>
Up in the night sky, a tiny star named Twinkle was afraid to shine.
“I’m too small,” Twinkle whispered, hiding behind a cloud.
One night, a lost bunny looked up from a dark forest.
Twinkle gathered courage… and sparkled just a little.

The bunny saw the light and followed it home.
From then on, Twinkle shined every night, just in case someone needed it.
The other stars clapped and twinkled with joy.
Twinkle was no longer shy — just proud.
Even the smallest light can guide the way.
All it takes is a little bravery.</h3></pre>

He poured his gentle rain down, drop by drop.
The flowers lifted their heads and smiled.
Children laughed and danced in the puddles.
The big clouds saw how happy everyone was.
From then on, they shared their rain too.
