        Once upon a calm morning, a boy named Nilo paddled his little wooden boat into the center of Silent Lake. The water was smooth as glass, and the only sound was the soft splash of his oars. 🛶🌅

He wasn’t in a rush. Nilo loved the peace of fishing — the way it gave him time to think and dream.

He dropped his fishing line into the water and whispered,
“Just one fish today. That’s all I need.”

Suddenly — TUG! 🎣💥

His fishing pole bent sharply. He reeled and pulled… and out of the water came not an ordinary fish — but a shimmering, blue-and-gold fish with glowing eyes! 🐟✨

“Whoa!” Nilo gasped.

To his shock, the fish spoke.

“Put me back, and I’ll grant you one wish.”

Nilo blinked. “You can talk?!”

The fish flipped its tail. “Yes — and I’m late for a seaweed sandwich party.”

Nilo laughed. “Okay, okay.”

He gently placed the fish back into the lake.

As it swam off, it called out,
“Your wish will come when you truly need it!”

Days passed. Then weeks. Nothing happened.

But one afternoon, when a storm rolled in and Nilo’s boat got stuck in the middle of the lake, lightning flashed, and waves rocked his boat — suddenly, a giant wave lifted him up and gently placed him back near the shore.

The lake was calm again.

And in the ripples, Nilo swore he heard:
“Wish granted.” 💙🐟
