        Every autumn morning, Mr. Elric stood quietly on his porch 🪵 with a warm mug of coffee ☕ in his hands. His cozy house 🏡 was tucked at the edge of Mapleberry Lane, where golden leaves 🍂 floated like dreams and squirrels chased each other in the trees 🌰🐿️.

He loved the stillness.

One morning, as fog curled low around the fence and the sunrise painted the sky with orange and peach 🌄, something in his garden caught his eye.

Right there — in the middle of his pumpkin patch 🎃🎃🎃 — one pumpkin was wiggling.

“Hm?” he murmured, adjusting his glasses. “That’s odd…”

He stepped off the porch, slippers crunching on frosty grass. The pumpkin wiggled again… and sneezed.

“ACHOO!” 🎃👦

Startled, Mr. Elric bent down and gently lifted the top off the pumpkin. Inside was a little boy, cheeks red, nose sniffly, bundled in a scarf and giggling. 😄🧣

“Hello!” the boy chirped. “I’m hiding!”

“In my pumpkin?” Elric asked, raising an eyebrow.

“It was the biggest one,” the boy said proudly. “Perfect for a pumpkin house!”

Mr. Elric laughed, his coffee steaming in the cold air. “Well, you’ve got good taste.”

They sat together on the porch — the boy in his pumpkin, Mr. Elric on his rocking chair — sipping warm cider and cocoa ☕🍫.

Turns out, the boy was new to the neighborhood. His name was Finn, and he had moved in just two houses down. He loved adventures, especially ones with pumpkins, leaves, and stories.

Mr. Elric shared tales of pumpkin moons 🌕🎃, talking crows 🐦, and magical wind chimes.

From that day on, every morning in autumn, there were two people on the porch — one man with his coffee, and one pumpkin with a boy inside.

And peace? It was still there — only now, it giggled sometimes.
