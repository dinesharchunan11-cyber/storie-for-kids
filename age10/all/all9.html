      <pre class="left"><h2>
        In the golden heart of the Sun Plains, where the grass swayed like ocean waves and the sun always seemed to smile, lived a young lion named Leo. 🦁🌾

Leo had a big mane, a bright heart, and the loudest roar in the land — or at least, he used to.

One morning, after chasing butterflies and rolling in the dust, Leo tried to roar...

And nothing came out.

“Rr... rrr... meep?” he squeaked.

The birds giggled. The meerkats chuckled. Even the giraffes smiled politely.

Leo’s ears drooped.

He tried again. Nothing.

His roar was gone.

So, Leo went on a journey across the savannah to find it.

He asked the wise elephant 🐘,
“Have you seen my roar?”

The elephant shook her head gently.
“Roars are not seen, little one. They're felt.”

He asked the colorful parrots 🦜,
“Can you give me a roar?”

They chirped,
“We only give songs, not roars!”

He even asked the monkeys, who offered to yell for him — but it just wasn’t the same. 🙉

Tired and quiet, Leo curled up under a tree that night and whispered,
“I guess I’m not a real lion anymore…”

Just then, he heard a small cry —
“Help! Help!”

It was a baby antelope stuck in a thorn bush. 🦌🌿

Without thinking, Leo leapt to his feet, rushed over, and carefully used his teeth and paws to pull the thorns away.

“You’re safe now,” he said softly.

The antelope looked up at him, eyes wide.
“You didn’t roar... but you were still so brave.”

And in that moment, something stirred inside Leo — not loud, but strong.

The next morning, as the sun rose, Leo climbed to the top of Pride Rock, took a deep breath, and...

“ROOOAAARRRRRR!” 🦁☀️

His roar echoed across the plains — louder than ever before.

Because this time, it came from is heart
