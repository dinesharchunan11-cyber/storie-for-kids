      <pre class="left"><h2>
        In a snowy forest where icicles chimed like wind chimes and the trees wore white coats, there lived a fluffy brown bear named Barlo. 🐻

But Barlo wasn’t your average bear.

Every winter, the forest animals had a big Snow Carnival, where everyone dressed up as someone — or something — else. 🎉⛄

Foxes wore owl feathers 🦉, raccoons dressed as snowmen ⛄, and squirrels came as pine trees 🎄.

Barlo wanted to do something different this year. Something funny.

“I’m going to be a goat!” he announced proudly.

The other animals blinked. “A goat?”

“Yes!” Barlo said, his eyes twinkling. “With horns and a beard and a ‘maaah’ that echoes!”

So he stitched together a goat costume from wool and snow, carefully curved icicles into horns, and tied a silver bell around his neck. 🔔🐐❄️

When the Snow Carnival began, Barlo clomped into the clearing — in full goat mode.

He trotted, kicked, and made the silliest "Maaaaa!" sounds the forest had ever heard.

The animals howled with laughter. 😂

“You're the best goat we’ve ever seen!” giggled a squirrel.

Barlo bowed dramatically. “Thank you, thank you. I’m the Bear-Goat of Snow Hill!”

Then something even better happened: all the animals started joining in.

The fox began baa-ing, the owl pretended to chew grass, and even the grumpy old badger wore pinecone horns and joined the goat parade.

That day, the snow echoed with laughter, hoof-steps, and the happiest “maaaahs” in the world.
