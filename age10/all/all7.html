      <pre class="left"><h2>
        In a small village tucked between green hills and wildflower fields, there lived a curious little girl named Lila. 🌼👧

She had big, bright eyes that sparkled like morning dew, and hair that always danced in the wind — because Lila spent most of her days outside, exploring.

She loved the wind more than anything.

It blew through the trees, tickled her cheeks, and carried the scent of honey and grass. But Lila believed something magical about the wind…

She believed it could talk. 🌬️✨

One sunny afternoon, as she twirled through the field in her favorite blue dress, Lila heard a soft whisper.

"Come find me..." it said.

She froze. “Who’s there?”

The wind rustled the tall grass and whispered again, “Follow the butterflies…” 🦋

Without hesitation, Lila chased after the fluttering trail of butterflies that led her beyond the familiar path — past the brook, through a grove of singing birds, and into a circle of ancient trees. 🌳🌳🌳

At the center stood a glowing flower she had never seen before — silver petals and a golden center, swaying in a windless breeze.

As she reached out to touch it, the wind wrapped around her gently, like a hug, and spoke once more:

"Thank you, Lila. You listened."

The flower shimmered, and from it, hundreds of tiny glowing seeds lifted into the air, floating off into the sky like little stars. 🌟

The whisper returned, soft and happy:

"Now others will hear me too."

Lila smiled. She didn’t fully understand the magic — not yet — but she knew one thing: kindness, wonder, and listening to the world made it come alive.

And from that day on, the wind always called her by name.
