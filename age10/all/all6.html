      <pre class="left"><h2>
        On a crisp Halloween morning, when the fog hugged the hills and the pumpkins smiled on porches 🎃, a little ghost named Glimmer zipped through the air with a swoosh!

“Wheee!” she giggled, doing flips through the falling leaves 🍂.

But Glimmer wasn’t like the other ghosts in Moonlight Hollow.

While the other ghosts loved to scare, Glimmer loved to care.

Instead of saying “Boo!” she said “Hi!”

Instead of hiding behind tombstones, she helped decorate them with ribbons and glitter ✨.

All the other ghosts would roll their eyes.

“Glimmer, Halloween is for spooking!” groaned one old ghost.

But Glimmer just smiled. “It can also be for smiling.”

That afternoon, the village filled with children in costumes — little witches, mini monsters, pirates, and princesses. 🧙‍♀️🦹‍♂️👑

Glimmer flew low above them, invisible to most — but not to one.

A quiet boy named Milo, dressed as a wizard, looked up and gasped. “A ghost!”

Glimmer stopped. “You can see me?”

Milo nodded. “Are you gonna scare me?”

Glimmer floated in a loop. “Not unless you want me to!”

Milo laughed. “No thanks. Want to walk with me?”

So the ghost and the wizard walked door to door. Glimmer helped carry candy bags, floated lanterns, and even made a giggling cat float in the air for a trick. 🪄🐱🍬

The night ended with fireworks over the hill, and Milo whispered, “This was the best Halloween ever.”

Glimmer glowed brighter than ever before. “Me too.”

From that day on, every Halloween, Milo would walk through Moonlight Hollow — and somewhere just above his head, a giggling ghost would follow. 👻✨
