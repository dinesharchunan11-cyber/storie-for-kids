     <h1>STORIE:🦆 Chapter 1: Dilly the Duck and the Crunchy Crumbs</h1>

      <pre class="left"><h2>
         
In the quiet, snowy corner of the world known as Hollow Win, where snowflakes danced like feathers and pine trees whispered secrets to the wind, lived a curious little duck named Dilly.

Dilly was not like other ducks. While most ducks stayed close to their frozen ponds, waddling in circles and snuggling into warm feathers, Dilly was always exploring.

One chilly morning, as the sky blushed pink with sunrise, Dilly’s tummy gave a loud grrrrrumble.

“Quack! I need a snack!” she declared, flapping her wings.

She poked her head out of her nest, buried in a snowbank near the edge of the forest. The snow sparkled like tiny stars, and the world looked quiet and still — the kind of morning where something magical might happen.

Just as Dilly was about to nibble on an old pinecone (her least favorite snack), she saw something unusual in the snow.

✨ A single golden crumb.

She blinked. “What’s this?” she said aloud.

She waddled closer and sniffed. It smelled like roasted corn and honey — definitely not a pinecone. Then she saw another crumb a little farther ahead, and then another.

“A snack trail!” Dilly quacked, excited. “And it smells delicious!”

Without a second thought, she followed the trail.

The crumbs sparkled under the morning sun, forming a twinkling path that twisted past frozen ponds, around snowy berry bushes, and beneath bending icicle-covered branches. Everywhere she looked, nature seemed to pause and watch her — even the wind grew quiet.

As she waddled farther from her nest, Dilly began to wonder who had dropped the crumbs.

“Maybe a giant bird?” she guessed.
“Or a silly squirrel who forgot where his snacks went?”
“Or maybe… someone who wants me to find them?”

The path grew steeper, climbing a small snowy hill. Dilly panted a little — ducks aren’t great at hiking, after all — but she was determined.

At the top of the hill, she paused and looked back. Her footprints in the snow were the only ones behind her.

“It’s just me out here,” she whispered. The forest was silent, except for the soft crunch of her webbed feet in the snow.

She kept going.

As she reached the bottom of the hill, the trail of crumbs suddenly stopped beside a crooked old log. Dilly blinked.

“No more crumbs?” she quacked, puzzled.

She waddled in circles, sniffed the air, even looked under the log, but there was nothing. The trail had ended.

And then — SNAP! — a sound from behind the log!

Dilly froze. Her feathers stood on end. Was it a fox? A cat? A snow monster?

Crunch... crunch...

A small figure slowly stood up from behind the log.

It was a chipmunk, wearing a wooly scarf and holding a tiny satchel.

“Oh!” said the chipmunk. “I didn’t mean to scare you.”

“You dropped your snacks,” Dilly said, pointing to the trail of crumbs.

The chipmunk chuckled. “Oh, those weren’t dropped. I left them behind on purpose.”

Dilly tilted her head. “Why?”

“Because,” said the chipmunk with a warm smile, “I hoped someone like you would follow them. It gets lonely out here, and I wanted a new friend.”

Dilly’s eyes widened. “You made a snack trail… just to find a friend?”

The chipmunk nodded. “And it worked!”

Dilly quacked with joy. “I followed it because I was hungry — but finding a friend is even better than a snack!”

The two new friends sat by the log, sharing the last of the corn and honey crumbs, telling stories, and watching snowflakes twirl down from the sky.
