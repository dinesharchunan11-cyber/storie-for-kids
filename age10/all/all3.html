      <pre class="left"><h2>
        Every morning, Mr. Elric stood on the wooden porch of his small cottage, holding a warm mug of coffee in both hands.

He didn’t say much. He didn’t need to.

The sun would rise slowly behind the hills, painting the sky in oranges and soft purples. Birds would chirp, one by one. The old oak tree in his yard would sway slightly in the morning breeze.

This was his favorite time — before the world asked anything of him.

Years ago, Mr. Elric had been a busy man: always working, always moving, always thinking of what came next.

But time, and a few hard lessons, had taught him the value of the present.

Now, instead of chasing success or worrying about mistakes, he chased sunlight across the porch and noticed the warmth of the mug in his hands.

Children would sometimes pass by on their way to school and wave. He’d smile, lift his mug in greeting, and go back to watching the sky.

He had everything he needed: peace, a place to call home, and a morning to be thankful for.

One day, a young man from the city walked by, rushing to catch a bus. He stopped and asked, “Sir, what are you always looking at out here?”

Mr. Elric smiled. “Nothing much,” he said. “And that’s the best part.”

The young man blinked. “I don’t get it.”

“You will,” Elric replied gently, sipping his coffee. “One day, you’ll realize that the quietest moments are the ones that make life feel full.”

The bus came. The young man left.

And Mr. Elric stood quietly, savoring the steam rising from his cup and the silence that said more than words ever could.
