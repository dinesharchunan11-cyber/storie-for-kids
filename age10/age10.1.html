     <h1>STORIE: 🧜‍♂️ The Magic Fish and the Greedy Fisherman</h1>
      <div>

      <pre><h2 class="this">
  Once upon a time, in a quiet village by the sea, lived an old fisherman named Tomas. He was poor but kind-hearted, and every day he cast his net into the ocean, hoping for a good catch.

One morning, Tomas caught something strange. It was a shimmering golden fish, unlike any he had ever seen. As he reached to take it out of the net, the fish spoke:

“Please let me go, kind fisherman. I am a magic fish, and I will grant you one wish if you spare my life.”

Amazed, Tomas replied, “I don’t need much. My roof leaks and my boat is old—just fix those, and I’ll be happy.”

The fish flicked its tail, and in a flash of light, Tomas’s boat was brand new, and his house stood sturdy with a strong roof.

Tomas thanked the fish and let it go. He returned home and lived comfortably. But when his wife heard the story, she was not satisfied.

“You could’ve asked for a mansion!” she scolded. “Go back and ask for more!”

Tomas was reluctant, but he returned to the shore and called the fish. It appeared again.

“I’m sorry, but could I wish for a bigger house?” Tomas asked shyly.

The fish nodded. “As you wish,” it said, and vanished.

When Tomas returned, his small cottage had turned into a grand house.

Days passed, and his wife became even greedier. “We could be royalty! Go ask to be king and queen!”

Tomas hesitated, but again returned to the sea. The sky had turned gray.

“Magic fish,” he called. “My wife wishes to be queen.”

The fish emerged, its glow dimmer. “Be careful what you wish for,” it warned, before disappearing under the waves.

That night, the house transformed into a palace. Servants filled the halls. But the more they had, the more they wanted. Eventually, his wife demanded to rule the world.

Frightened, Tomas returned one last time.

“Please,” he whispered, “she wants to rule everything.”

This time, the sea churned. The fish rose from the waves, its eyes sad.

“You have gone too far,” it said. “Your heart was once content, but now it is filled with greed.”

And with a final splash, the fish vanished.

Tomas returned home—to find the palace gone, the grand house vanished, and even his old cottage missing. He stood barefoot on the sand, beside his leaky boat and broken nets.
